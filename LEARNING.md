# ðŸ“š LEARNING NOTES

## ðŸ”¥ Highlights
- Built with FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Scikit-learn
- Uses yfinance to fetch data and PostgreSQL to store it
- Docker orchestrates services for reproducible environment

## âœ… What you can learn
- Structure of ML microservices with REST APIs
- Containerization with Docker Compose
- Basic data science pipeline: fetch â†’ store â†’ train â†’ predict
- Building simple frontend in FastAPI with Jinja2

## ðŸš€ Next steps
- Improve feature engineering (add financial ratios)
- Try other regressors (XGBoost, Ridge)
- Add authentication for endpoints
- Set up scheduled cron jobs to fetch data
